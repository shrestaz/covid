    "After the initial plotting, it is clear that there was a strong impact of COVID-19 around late March--early April. The number of people who were dying due to COVID-19, as indicated by red line, and who were hospitalized, as indicated by the blue line, increased sharply. The first, month-long lockdown was imposed during this period, as indicated by the soft-orange shade. The result of the lockdown was effective as the number of reported hospitalization started to decline and kept declining over the next few months. The number of deaths was still rising at the end of the first lockdown, but started to stabilize soon after.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a positive indication that the imposed lockdown was effective in controlling the spread of the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the restictions started to loosen up, the public started to gather in larger numbers, which was an opportunity for the virus to spread again. This is indicated by the rise on both total deaths and hospitalized starting September. To control the rapid increase, the government mandated the use of mask on all public places starting October 29, represented by the black, dashed line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever since, the numbers started to grow. The plot above shows a sharp incline starting November. And with the holidays starting, the government imposed second lockdown starting December 09, 2020, which is the date of conducting this experiment. This was an attempt to reduce the number of gatherings and parties, and limit them to families to control the spread of the COVID-19."

    "While the first plot was impactful, a more meaningful one would be to analyze the data between total number of people tested (plot A) and total number of confirmed cases (plot B). When visualising them individually, both of the plots A and B shows almost linear growth as the months go by. Without much context, this is very worrying and can be taken out of proportion. By when combining them and visualizing them on the same plot (plot C), it becomes much clearer that the situation is not as bad. Yes, the number of cases are increasing, but when comparing them to the number of tests done, the result has a vastly different conclusion.\n",
