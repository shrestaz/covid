    "### 3.2 Data wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the target data is loaded and ready to be used, we print a few columns of the data with `head` command and inspect if any transformations are required. In the initial inspection, the data looks to be well prepared and organized but still not ready to be used. Based on the requirements and researchers, the transformations required is subjective. For our use case, the required transformations are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "_**This process of transforming data into another format is called \"data wrangling\".**_\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The key indicators, i.e the names describing the values, are the first values of each rows. Ideally, they should be the first values in each of columns. In simple terms, the x-axis and y-axis needs to be reversed. This requires the dataframe to be transposed (or rotated).\n",
    "2. The key indicator names are very long. To adhere to R's naming covention, we rename each of the key indicators to short, meaningful names and follow snake case using \"_\", for example `some_key_indicator`.\n",
    "3. The format of the date is \"MxxDxx\". For maximum flexibility and understanding, we transform this to the international ISO date format of `yyyy-mm-dd`. This is done using R's built in functions in the following steps.\n",
    "4. This dataset is missing one of the key figures, which is the daily new cases. Since we have the total number of cases for everyday, we substract that value of a day with that value of the day before to calculate the daily new cases. \n",
    "    - For example: total case for March 22 = 1395, total case for March 21 = 1326. So daily new case of March 21 = 1395 - 1326 = 69.\n",
    "5. The missing values are represented by `..`. Those should updated to either empty values or `NA` so that R can interpret it as missing value.\n",
    "6. Change the data types of the attributes if needed. Since the data is read from a CSV file, R may not be able to correctly interpret the data type. For example, if `total_tested` is interpreted as `character` instead of `numeric`, it'll fail to plot the data or train a model based on that data."

    "After the initial plotting, it is clear that there was a strong impact of COVID-19 around late March--early April. The number of people who were dying due to COVID-19, as indicated by red line, and who were hospitalized, as indicated by the blue line, increased sharply. The first, month-long lockdown was imposed during this period, as indicated by the soft-orange shade. The result of the lockdown was effective as the number of reported hospitalization started to decline and kept declining over the next few months. The number of deaths was still rising at the end of the first lockdown, but started to stabilize soon after.\n",

    "This was a positive indication that the imposed lockdown was effective in controlling the spread of the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the restictions started to loosen up, the public started to gather in larger numbers, which was an opportunity for the virus to spread again. This is indicated by the rise on both total deaths and hospitalized starting September. To control the rapid increase, the government mandated the use of mask on all public places starting October 29, represented by the black, dashed line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever since, the numbers started to grow. The plot above shows a sharp incline starting November. And with the holidays starting, the government imposed second lockdown starting December 09, 2020, which is the date of conducting this experiment. This was an attempt to reduce the number of gatherings and parties, and limit them to families to control the spread of the COVID-19."

    "While the first plot was impactful, a more meaningful one would be to analyze the data between total number of people tested (plot A) and total number of confirmed cases (plot B). When visualising them individually, both of the plots A and B shows almost linear growth as the months go by. Without much context, this is very worrying and can be taken out of proportion. By when combining them and visualizing them on the same plot (plot C), it becomes much clearer that the situation is not as bad. Yes, the number of cases are increasing, but when comparing them to the number of tests done, the result has a vastly different conclusion.\n",
