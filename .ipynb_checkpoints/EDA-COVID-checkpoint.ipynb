    "\n",
    "Now that the target data is loaded and ready to be used, we print a few columns of the data with `head` command and inspect if any transformations are required. In the initial inspection, the data looks to be well prepared and organized but still not ready to be used. Based on the requirements and researchers, the transformations required is subjective. For our use case, the required transformations are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "_**This process of transforming data into another format is called \"data wrangling\".**_\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The key indicators, i.e the names describing the values, are the first values of each rows. Ideally, they should be the first values in each of columns. In simple terms, the x-axis and y-axis needs to be reversed. This requires the dataframe to be transposed (or rotated).\n",
    "2. The key indicator names are very long. To adhere to R's naming covention, we rename each of the key indicators to short, meaningful names and follow snake case using \"_\", for example `some_key_indicator`.\n",
    "3. The format of the date is \"MxxDxx\". For maximum flexibility and understanding, we transform this to the international ISO date format of `yyyy-mm-dd`. This is done using R's built in functions in the following steps.\n",
    "4. This dataset is missing one of the key figures, which is the daily new cases. Since we have the total number of cases for everyday, we substract that value of a day with that value of the day before to calculate the daily new cases. \n",
    "    - For example: total case for March 22 = 1395, total case for March 21 = 1326. So daily new case of March 21 = 1395 - 1326 = 69.\n",
    "5. The missing values are represented by `..`. Those should updated to either empty values or `NA` so that R can interpret it as missing value.\n",
    "6. Change the data types of the attributes if needed. Since the data is read from a CSV file, R may not be able to correctly interpret the data type. For example, if `total_tested` is interpreted as `character` instead of `numeric`, it'll fail to plot the data or train a model based on that data."

    "\n",
    "The plot shows that the initial lockdown from March 21, 2020 to April 13, 2020 certainly aided in reducing the number of daily cases. While the numbers stayed low for a few months, the number of new daily cases certainly started to gain inclination from September onwards. The mask mandate enforced from end of October barely helped in flattening the curve and the line started to peak during the end of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps in explaining that when the pandemic was new and under-studied, the public must have been extra careful. But as time went on, it seems like this was no longer the case. Even with the mask mandate and second lockdown in place, the plot resulted in steep incline in the slope with record-breaking daily cases in December. This shows that our hypothesis is wrong as it fails to take into account for the number of COVID tests, people's behaviour and intentions, especially during holiday seasons and other similar factors."

    "\n",
    "The plot above, Plot 1, visualizes that the number of cases increased as the time passed by. But this plot is missing a key factor in understanding why there was an increase in cases. To get a better understanding, we must also take into account the increase in testing done to confirm COVID-19 cases. In the initial days, there were limited supply of testing resources so only the vulnerable ones were tested. But as the testing resources expanded over time, the non-vulnerable group of people also got the opportubity to be tested. This is one of the factors resulting in increase of cases as shown in plot 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize this hypothesis, we can plot them on a graph and analyse the behaviour over time. The idea is to get a glance at the relationship between the total tests conducted and total confirmed cases."

    "The scatter plot confirms that the relation between the 2 variables, confirmed cases and total people tested, has a positive, strong and non-linear relationship. The relationship is positive because of the nature of the linear line (blue in color) slanting upwards, from left to right. Since the plots do not follow the shape or form of the liner line, the relationship’s form is non-linear. Finally, the variables have a strong relationship because they are follow a certain curve and are in compact alignment, meaning they are not scattered all over the chart.\n",

    "In this experiment, we carried out our own Exploratory Data Analysis for Denmark's COVID-19 cases. We used data from Statistikbanken which consists of official data collected throughout the pandemic. The goal was to use historical data to analyze the effects of decisions enforced by the officials, and investigate if they had any effect in controlling the spread of the virus. Additionally, we used machine learning to build models and predict if the number of total cases would increase or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "And the verdict was that with the current trend, the predicted cases would increase over the next two weeks (from December 15, 2020). The important thing to keep in mind is that there are many non-measured variables which play an important role in controlling the spread of virus. While this experiment used the raw data exposing the number of cases, tests, etc., it doens't take into account the introduction of vaccination, effect of holidays, people's behaviour towards gatherings and ignoring the use of mask in public, among many others. This is purely a statistical analysis to understand the numbers, effects of governmental decisions and predicting the future using machine learning."
